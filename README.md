This repository contains implementations of parallel and serial graph algorithms in C. It leverages multi-threading and a thread pool to parallelize operations for improved performance on large datasets.

Files Overview
os_graph.c, os_graph.h: Graph data structures and functions
os_threadpool.c, os_threadpool.h: Threadpool management
serial.c: Serial version of the graph algorithm
parallel.c: Parallel version using thread pool
